it takes way too long to bootstrap a master. I may prebootstrap a puppetmaster where all I have to do is fire it up.

Should be able to prefix the hostname before every log line

Should be able to use a screen session to ssh into all nodes in a stack

Should be able to specify all of your connection defaults in a config file
